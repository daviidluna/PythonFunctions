# PythonFunctions

## Notes:
* A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
* You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
* A function can return data as a result. 
* To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis 
* Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
* Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
* By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less


    - From a function's perspective:
    - A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
    - An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
